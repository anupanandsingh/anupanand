Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to integrability, the broad area of my research. Characterised by a set of equations that can be "solved exactly", an integrable system is highly symmetrical and has fascinating mathematical structures. And while integrability in the natural world is rare, it offers valuable insights into the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature.

My work is aimed at improving our understanding of what are called classical integrable theories and creating a framework for their covariant quantisation. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Geometry and Mathematical Physics group at Loughborough University, where I am mentored by <a href="https://matsvermeeren.xyz" target="_self">Mats Vermeeren</a>. My work is supported by the EPSRC project grant <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FY006712%2F1" target="_self">Lagrangian Multiforms for Symmetries and Integrability: Classification, Geometry, and Applications</a>. From July 2022 to September 2025, I was a PhD student in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, supported by an <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=studentship-2704447" target="_self">EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership Studentship</a>. With my supervisors <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4011/dr-vincent-caudrelier" target="_self">Vincent Caudrelier</a> and <a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/4034/dr-derek-harland" target="_self">Derek Harland</a>, and some of my <a href="https://anupanand.space/collaborators" target="_self">collaborators</a>, I constructed a novel variational framework formulated in phase space that describes hierarchies of finite-dimensional integrable systems.
